## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/Sentiment-Classification-for-Reviews.git
   cd Sentiment-Classification-for-Reviews
   ```

2. **Install the required dependencies**:

   Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Google Colab Setup**:

   If you're running the notebook on Google Colab, ensure that your Google Drive is mounted:

   ```python
   from google.colab import drive
   drive.mount('/content/drive')
   ```

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**:

   The dataset should be preprocessed to tokenize the Arabic text and prepare it for training. The notebook includes code for embedding the text data using various layers like `Embedding`, `SimpleRNN`, `LSTM`, etc.

2. **Training the Model**:

   The notebook provides a script to build and train the model. The model architecture can be customized using layers such as `Dense`, `Dropout`, and `Flatten`.

   Example:

   ```python
   model = Sequential()
   model.add(Embedding(input_dim=10000, output_dim=128))
   model.add(LSTM(128))
   model.add(Dropout(0.5))
   model.add(Dense(3, activation='softmax'))
   ```

   After defining the model, compile and train it:

   ```python
   model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
   model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, validation_split=0.2, callbacks=[EarlyStopping(monitor='val_loss', patience=2)])
   ```

3. **Evaluation**:

   Evaluate the model's performance on the test set to determine its accuracy and generalization capability.

   ```python
   model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
   ```

## Data

The dataset used for this project should consist of Arabic reviews labeled as Positive, Negative, or Neutral. The data needs to be preprocessed and split into training and testing sets.

## Model

The model is built using TensorFlow/Keras and can be customized with different layers and architectures. The default model provided in the notebook uses LSTM layers, but you can experiment with other RNN variants or even CNNs.

## Evaluation

The model is evaluated based on accuracy, loss, and possibly other metrics such as F1-score or AUC depending on the needs of your application.
